	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>
My name is Jack Lukomski, and I am a computer engineering graduate from Grand Valley State University. I have a passion for technology and a strong foundation in embedded systems, deep learning, and computer vision.

In the field of deep learning, I have experience with generative AI models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). During my college research, I focused on mitigating bias and improving the realism of VAE-generated results through adversarial feedback. I am also proficient in object detection architectures like YOLO and have worked extensively with OpenCV for computer vision applications.

In embedded systems, I have hands-on experience with FreeRTOS and ARM- and RISC-based architectures, allowing me to work on resource-efficient and high-performance solutions.

Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy spending time exploring computers, watching college football, hitting the gym, cooking, and reading. My diverse interests help me stay curious and continually motivated to learn and grow.
